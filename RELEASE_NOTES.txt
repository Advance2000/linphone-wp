See README.txt file for an explanation about how the project is working and how to compile it.

04-25-2013:
* Incoming calls are working in background mode but need push notifications to be notified
* Audio codecs available: ARM-NB, ARM-WB, Speex/16000, Speex/8000, PCMU/8000, PCMA/8000, G722, iLBC, SILK/16000, GSM
* UDP, TCP and TLS are supported for SIP transport
* Tunnel support
* Call pause/resume working correctly
* DTMF sending method configuration
* Persistent call history
* WebRTC echo canceller can be enabled
* C++/Cx API wrapper completely filled and documented for audio communications

03-29-2013:
* Outgoing calls are working
* Incoming calls are working when the app is in foreground
* The only codec available for now is PCMU/8000
* Only UDP is supported as transport at the moment
* Can go to background when a call is running without killing the app
* History is displaying all calls logs correctly until reboot (no persistence yet)
* Call can be paused/resumed (from other side only for now, crash if trying to do from wp) 
* Speaker and mute are working 
* Can register sip account from settings
* Logging of linphone messages in separate file, see README to know how to retrieve it
* Prevent user to leave the incall page using back button (can lead to close app during call unexpectedly)

03-01-2013:
* Improved stubs to mimic liblinphone behavior (registration states, call states, global states) amd fake call logs
* Can simulate incoming/outcoing calls 

02-15-2013:
* Liblinphone documented C++/Cx wrapper directly usable in C#
* Part of the graphical interface (call related interface not working)
