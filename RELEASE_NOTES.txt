In order to compile Linphone, you need:
* A computer with Windows 8 (Pro if you want to use the emulator)
* Visual Studio 11 (2012)
* The Windows Phone 8 SDK
* wget, awk and unzip from the GnuWin32 project and put them in your path (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) for some mediastreamer2 codecs

To import the solution, open the Linphone.sln file at the root of the project.

To compile and run it, plug a windows phone 8 device or choose an emulator 
and run the build/install (using F5 or the green triangle). The app will start
automatically once built.

/!\ Please check the Linphone project in the solution is set as startup project.
(The startup project is in bold in the project list)
If not, right click on Linphone project and choose the menu "Set as StartUp project".

See README.txt file for an explanation about how the project is working.

04-25-2013:
* Incoming calls are working in background mode but need push notifications to be notified
* Audio codecs available: ARM-NB, ARM-WB, Speex/16000, Speex/8000, PCMU/8000, PCMA/8000, G722, iLBC, SILK/16000, GSM
* UDP, TCP and TLS are supported for SIP transport
* Tunnel support
* Call pause/resume working correctly
* DTMF sending method configuration
* Persistent call history
* WebRTC echo canceller can be enabled
* C++/Cx API wrapper completely filled and documented for audio communications

03-29-2013:
* Outgoing calls are working
* Incoming calls are working when the app is in foreground
* The only codec available for now is PCMU/8000
* Only UDP is supported as transport at the moment
* Can go to background when a call is running without killing the app
* History is displaying all calls logs correctly until reboot (no persistence yet)
* Call can be paused/resumed (from other side only for now, crash if trying to do from wp) 
* Speaker and mute are working 
* Can register sip account from settings
* Logging of linphone messages in separate file, see README to know how to retrieve it
* Prevent user to leave the incall page using back button (can lead to close app during call unexpectedly)

03-01-2013:
* Improved stubs to mimic liblinphone behavior (registration states, call states, global states) amd fake call logs
* Can simulate incoming/outcoing calls 

02-15-2013:
* Liblinphone documented C++/Cx wrapper directly usable in C#
* Part of the graphical interface (call related interface not working)
